#summary Some RobotC Resources


To learn more about RobotC please checkout the NXT Curriculum (its more of a series of tutorials than a full curriculum): http://www.robotc.net/education/curriculum/nxt/. Don't worry so much about the motor control section (though do take a peek at that). However you should look most into the Variables section which seems to have more than variables. In particular take a look at [http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_if_else.pdf If-Else], [http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_functions.pdf Functions], [http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_variables.pdf Variables], [http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_boolean_algebra.pdf Boolean Logic], [http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_while_loop.pdf Whiles Loops] and [http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_global_variables.pdf Global Variables]. It is also sometimes useful when you have an idea to write it down as [http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_pseudo_flow.pdf Pseudo code or draw it up as a flow chart].

I hope these tutorials are useful. also keep in mind that RobotC is very similar to C. this means that many C functions and syntax will work in RobotC. It is therefore useful to lookup how to do something in C sometimes to figure out how to do something in RobotC. the [http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/ C Library Reference] is a pretty good overview of the C syntax
