To learn more about RobotC please checkout the NXT Curriculum (its more of a series of tutorials than a full curriculum): http://www.robotc.net/education/curriculum/nxt/. Don't worry so much about the motor control section (though do take a peek at that). However you should look most into the Variables section which seems to have more than variables. In particular take a look at [If-Else](http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_if_else.pdf), [Functions](http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_functions.pdf), [Variables](http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_variables.pdf), [Boolean Logic](http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_boolean_algebra.pdf), [Whiles Loops](http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_while_loop.pdf) and [Global Variables](http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_global_variables.pdf). It is also sometimes useful when you have an idea to write it down as [Pseudo code or draw it up as a flow chart](http://www.robotc.net/teachingmindstorms/reference/hp_pseudo_flow.pdf).

I hope these tutorials are useful. also keep in mind that RobotC is very similar to C. this means that many C functions and syntax will work in RobotC. It is therefore useful to lookup how to do something in C sometimes to figure out how to do something in RobotC. the [C Library Reference](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/) is a pretty good overview of the C syntax
